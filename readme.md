# Trace

## Introduction

Trace is currently guided by 3 principles, such that the user experience should respect that:
* Comments on an article are themselves articles belonging to the commenter, not the original article author.
* Comments can be focused on a phrase in an article as well as the whole article.
* Discussions branch in multiple dimensions instead of revolving around a single linear perspective.

We will attempt for this to be a new way of online interaction, one that would respect every author in a network, rather than just viewing them as a parent-child relationship. This new model will be applied to a number of domains to upend the standard model of interaction and information dissemination.

## Built With
